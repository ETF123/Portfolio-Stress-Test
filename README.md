Portfolio stress testing is a valuable tool to assess how a portfolio would perform under extreme or unfavorable conditions. It helps in understanding potential risks and preparing for adverse market movements. 
Stress testing based on Beta involves assessing how sensitive your portfolio or individual assets are to overall market movements. Beta is a measure of the volatility or systematic risk of a security relative to the overall market (typically, the S&P 500). A higher Beta indicates that the asset is more volatile than the market, while a lower Beta means it is less volatile.
Market Stress Simulation Using Beta:
Objective: Measure how much the portfolio value would change if the market moves by a certain percentage (e.g., during a market crash).
Approach: Use Beta to estimate the portfolioâ€™s sensitivity to a market-wide event, like a sudden drop in the market (e.g., 10% or 20% market decline)
